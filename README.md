# Description
In this homework, you should apply constrained TPC algorithm to a simple CDMA network. Consider a tow-cell 1000 m X 500 m network area. Two base stations are located in points (250; 250) m and (750; 250) m, respectively. Each
base station covers a 500 m X 500 m square area; additionally, five users are uniformly distributed through the each cell.
